## Features

### 1. **Dynamic Knowledge Base (FAISS-powered Retrieval System)**
- Finny stores a **knowledge base** of predefined loan-related information using the **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector store**.
- **How it works:**
  - When a user asks a question, the system searches the **most relevant** answer from the knowledge base.
  - If an answer is found, it is **displayed instantly**.
  - If no answer is found, Finny **intelligently learns** the new query over time and expands its knowledge base.

### 2. **AI-Powered Chatbot (Google Gemini AI Integration)**
- If a user asks a question **not covered** in the knowledge base, Finny will generate a response using **Google Gemini AI**.
- **How it works:**
  - The chatbot sends the question to **Google Gemini AI**.
  - The AI generates an **accurate, context-aware response**.
  - This ensures Finny is **always up-to-date** with the latest information.

### 3. **Speech-to-Text (STT) & Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Sarvam API**
